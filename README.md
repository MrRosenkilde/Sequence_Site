# Sequence_Site
A small MVP of a website that can generate different mathematical sequences. Developed with C and WebAssembly.

This project was made as a way to practice using WebAssembly and get some experience with C programming.

If you don't have Emscripten install run the install_emscripten.bat file to install it.
When/if you have installed Emscripten, run the make.bat file to build and run the project.
